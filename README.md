# Live Rating Update Reaction

## What is it?
Guilty Gear Strive doesn't have a good online ranking system, counting only wins at top level, regardless of losses. Someone made an unofficial ranking system called RatingUpdate(puddle.farm), which is still being
used today. This program opens up the user and their rank and makes it aware to them if they won or lost.

## Why?
I thought it was funny, and I wanted to see how much a fake elo system can affect how I enjoy playing games. It turns out that I hate playing tower with this on while I was testing, and it making me more aware of my
rank in general made me not like the game as much. But you know, nothing season 4 and a break can't fix.

I also haven't turned it into an exe so I'll do that eventually.
